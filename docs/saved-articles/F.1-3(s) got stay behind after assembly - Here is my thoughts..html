<h2>Overview of the event (Facts)</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>On 17th of October, 2024, 14:15-16:13, the Junior forms in La Salle College was having their assembly in the Hall.</li>
<li>During the assembly, the noise produced by the students, was consided "too loud and annoying" by the Vice Principal, Miss Cheung.</li>
<li>Miss Cheung ordered the F.1-3 student to stay behind till 16:03 while she reports and criticizes on the "extraordinarily bad" behavior inside and outside the campus with complain letters from the public, theft, reminders about road safety and littering issues.</li>
<li>After 16:03, Miss Cheung the Junior forms students to "calm down and be strictly silent" for 10 minute in which after she lets the Junior Form student leave.</li>
<li>She also warned (or threaded) the students to explain the whole incident to parents rather than "bits and pieces".</li>
<li>She also, unusualy, skipped singing the school song as she considered the students "not in the mood to be proud of the College"</li>
<li>She also ordered the janitors to keep the classroom doors open in order to let the student to take their belongings and leave the College.</li></ul></details>

<details open=""><summary>
<h2>F.2s Student's opinion (and Teacher's Opinion)</h2></summary>
<p>According to some (about 7) La Salle Boys in F.2A, F.2B, F.2D &amp; F.2G, they considedï¼š</p>
<ul>
<li>The act of staying the Junior Forms behind is "highly unusual and unjust for the F.2s and F.3s" and;</li>
<li>Accusing the boys in F.1 for producing noises and the F.2s has "no responsibility", in which;</li>
<li>One of the F.2A student claimed that "one of the F.1 boys stole 10 wallets" and;
<ul>
<li>The student further accused that "That F.1 boy IS the main cause of the incidents";</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One of the boys in F.2G has even claimed that Miss Cheung is "insane" and "enjoying torturing students"</li>
</ul>
<p>However, two boys (interviewed independently) in F.2G has a different, yet unanimous opinion, that said that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miss Cheung speech is "inspirational, and with a belief of change, and has the perseverance to take action";</li>
<li>One of the boys even claimed Miss Cheung as "clever", and "having a swift and comfortable change in 'carrot and sticks' "</li>
<li>Although they have some disagreement on their individual responsibility on the "extraordinarily bad" behavior in La Salle College and whether they deserve punishment, but;</li>
<li>Both of them agreed that Miss Cheung act is "a way, and possibly be the only way of enhancing La Salle students behaviour."</li>
</ul>
<p>Class teacher of F.2G, Mr. Terry Lam, in his Whatsapp group "2G Mathematics (2024-25)", posted a statement, to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>He considers that Class 2G has "NO responsibility" of the late wrap up of the school day;</li>
<li>He suggests that the students of Class 2G should "get used to the overrun of Thursday's assembly and notify parents"</li>
<li>He claims that the only way of leaving school on time is to "be calm and silent at all times" and "do NOT join the crowd to be disorganized".</li></ul></details>

<h2>My analysis on the students' responsibility</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>Although some students claim they have "NO responsibility", not only on the punishment, but also on the issues of her speech, I highly disagreed with that.</li>
<li>I often see F.1-2, and I claim the most F.1-6 students doing at least one, if not all of the following:
<ul>
<li>Swearing in English and Chinese at a fluent and constant pace.</li>
<li>Playing with each other in not gentle ways (e.g. Fighting, Hugging, Disrespect in others property)</li>
<li>Not tidying up after eating (in other words, littering)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those who "didn't done anything wrong" should also encourage others to adopt a similar outlook or help cleaning others mess to make a better environment instead of claiming innocence.</li>
<li>If you're really one of those who tried your best, I admire you. (I [Perseus] did not clean up other's mess.)</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>My analysis on the event</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>Her speech was truly inspirational, in which I could feel Miss Cheung urge for the La Salle students to change;</li>
<li>I also believe that some boys has truly embraced her words and reflect themselves.</li>
<li>In my opinion, Miss Cheung is one of the few teachers that has still got the hope and love to improve La Salle students behaviour and willing to take action instead of blindily executing very formal and non-effective orders.</li>
<li>In my opinion, Miss Cheung is also a leader in disciplinary and I personally believe she will bring La Salle on the right track in terms of self-discipline and behaviour.</li>
<li>However, I do not think expressing the increased personal workload due to the complain letters from the public caused by the reckless actions of students, as guilt, placed on all students is a good measure, as this may lead to downsides, such as:
<ul>
<li>Making the students feel that they are "bearing other's wrongdoing guilts", thus complaining about "wrongful treatment" or "injustice".</li>
<li>Furthermore, the students may consider "everything" as "not their fault", thus leading their focus to excuses and not self-reflection, making the whole "behaviour issues" part "effectively useless".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although 1 hour of staying behind is definitely enough to make the La Salle Junior Form student to "get the message", this could also disrupt students' and teachers' plans if they had events to go to.</li>
<li>Furthermore, it could also have a slight effect on the already concerning teacher-student relationship on Junior Forms as this act could be considered "disturbing" to students and they could see this as a "evil tease" from the "teacher overlords" and feel anger, which is hard to go away easily.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>My analysis on the motive of Miss Cheung</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>First, the discipline talk original purpose is to know right and wrong from others' mistakes or evil deeds.</li>
<li>It susessfully and near perfectly conveys and report on the issues in La Salle College.</li>
<li>However, this doubles as a fear, planted in student's brains, that teachers could and will take disciplinary actions.</li>
<li>Finally, The 10 minutes of "calm down time" could make some people calm down and truly think of improvement in discipline.</li>
<li>Although Miss Cheung has to be the "bad teacher" in others eyes, she still made the brave and resilliant choice to act.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>My prediction of La Salle students behaviour</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>This event planted a fear and anger that teachers could and will take disciplinary actions, and that won't go away any time soon.</li>
<li>However, as time pass, most students will only focus on "how bad the teachers were" instead of the reflection, because anger is much more easier to remember than student's own wrongdoing.</li>
<li>So, I hope that teachers will not use this event to scare students as this will further plants the anger towards the teachers, and;</li>
<li>I hope teachers will truly take action with patience and serve with heart, no matter if it is behaviour or teaching, because, at least by popular belief, teachers should be passionate on teaching instead of treating teaching as merely a normal job.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<h2>Conclusion</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>Miss Cheung speech is "inspirational, and with a belief of change, and has the perseverance to take action";</li>
<li>Miss Cheung is one of the few teachers that has still got the hope and love to improve La Salle students behaviour and willing to take action instead of blindily executing very formal and non-effective orders.</li>
<li>In my opinion, guilting students with personal workload is not an effective way of solving behaviour problems.</li>
<li>However, planting fear in student, while will work in short term, cannot work in long term and may lead to serious problems.</li>
</ul>
