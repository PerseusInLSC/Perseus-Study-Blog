&#13;
### Explanation of the Reasons&#13;
&#13;
1. **Intense Animal Husbandry and New Scientific Breeding Methods:**  &#13;
   The growth of intense animal husbandry in China, combined with new scientific breeding methods, has led to increased meat production. These advancements enable farmers to maximize output and efficiency, ensuring a stable supply of animal protein to meet the demands of a large population. This shift has significantly contributed to the overall increase in dietary protein availability.&#13;
&#13;
2. **Plant Proteins Advantages and Less Processed Meat:**  &#13;
   The Chinese diet incorporates a variety of plant-based proteins, which are not only healthier but also environmentally sustainable. Plant proteins require fewer resources to produce compared to animal proteins, resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the focus on less processed meat aligns with dietary recommendations, promoting better health while still meeting protein needs through a diverse array of food sources.。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://blog.lscstudy.us.kg/post/Perseus.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2024 02:03:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Gmeek 快速上手</title><link>https://blog.lscstudy.us.kg/post/Gmeek%20-kuai-su-shang-shou.html</link><description>&gt; [!NOTE]&#13;
