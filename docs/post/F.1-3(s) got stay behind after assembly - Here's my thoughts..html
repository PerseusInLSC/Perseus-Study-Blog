<h2>Overview of the Event (Facts)</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>On October 17, 2024, from 14:15 to 16:13, the junior forms at La Salle College held their assembly in the Hall.</li>
<li>During the assembly, the noise produced by the students was considered "too loud and annoying" by the Vice Principal, Miss Cheung.</li>
<li>Miss Cheung ordered the Form 1-3 students to stay behind until 16:03 while she reported on and criticized the "extraordinarily bad" manner &amp; behaviour both inside and outside the campus, citing complaints from the public, theft cases reported lately, reminders about road safety, and littering issues around the campus (LG1, tuck shop, archery court, basketball court).</li>
<li>After 16:03, Miss Cheung instructed the junior form students to "calm down and be strictly silent" for 10 minutes, after which she allowed them to leave.</li>
<li>She also warned (or threatened) the students to explain the entire incident to their parents rather than provide "bits and pieces."</li>
<li>Unusually, she skipped singing the school song, stating that the students were "not in the mood to be proud of the College."</li>
<li>Additionally, she ordered the janitors to keep the classroom doors open so that students could collect their belongings and leave the College.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>Form 2 Students' Opinions (and Teachers' Opinions)</h2></summary>
<p>According to some (about seven) La Salle boys in Form 2A, 2B, 2D, and 2G, they considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The act of keeping the junior forms behind is "highly unusual and unjust for the Form 2s and Form 3s."</li>
<li>Accusing the Form 1 boys for producing noise while Form 2s have "no responsibility."</li>
<li>One of the Form 2A students claimed that "one of the Form 1 boys stole 10 wallets," further accusing that "that Form 1 boy IS the main cause of the incidents."</li>
<li>One boy in Form 2G even claimed that Miss Cheung is "insane" and "enjoys torturing students."</li>
<li>Another boy in Form 2G citied some <em>rumors</em> that "all of the complaint letters were written by DBS(*) parents"<br>
(*) DBS - <a href="https://www.dbs.edu.hk/" rel="nofollow">Diocesan Boys' School</a>, a rival school of La Salle College</li>
</ul>
<p>However, two boys (interviewed independently) in Form 2G expressed a different yet unanimous opinion, stating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miss Cheung's speech was "inspirational, with a belief in change, and she has the perseverance to take action."</li>
<li>One of the boys even described Miss Cheung as "clever," and noted a "swift and comfortable change in 'carrot and sticks.'"</li>
<li>Although they disagreed on their individual responsibility regarding the "extraordinarily bad" behavior at La Salle College and whether they deserved punishment, both agreed that Miss Cheung's actions are "a way, and possibly the only way, of enhancing La Salle students' behavior."</li>
</ul>
<p>The class teacher of Form 2G, Mr. Terry Lam, posted a statement in his WhatsApp group "2G Mathematics (2024-25)" to summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>He believes that Class 2G has "NO responsibility" for the late wrap-up of the school day.</li>
<li>He suggests that the students of Class 2G should "get used to the overruns of Thursday's assembly and notify parents."</li>
<li>He claims that the only way to leave school on time is to "be calm and silent at all times" and "do NOT join the crowd to be disorganized."</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>My Analysis on the Students' Responsibility</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>Although some students claim they have "NO responsibility," not only regarding punishment but also concerning the issues raised in her speech, I strongly disagree with that.</li>
<li>I often observe Forms 1-2, and I assert that most students in Forms 1-6 engage in at least one, if not all, of the following behaviors:
<ul>
<li>Swearing in English and Chinese at a fluent and constant pace.</li>
<li>Playing with each other in ways that lack gentleness (e.g., fighting, hugging, disrespecting others' property).</li>
<li>Not tidying up after eating (littering).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Those who "didn't do anything wrong" should also encourage others to adopt a similar outlook or help clean up others' messes to create a better environment instead of claiming innocence.</li>
<li>If you truly are one of those who tried your best, I admire you. (I [Perseus] did not clean up others' mess.)</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>My Analysis on the Event</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>Her speech was genuinely inspirational; I could sense Miss Cheung's urge for La Salle students to change.</li>
<li>I also believe that some boys have genuinely embraced her words and reflected on themselves.</li>
<li>In my opinion, Miss Cheung is one of the few teachers who still has hope and love for improving La Salle students' behavior and is willing to take action rather than blindly executing very formal and ineffective orders.</li>
<li>I view Miss Cheung as a leader in discipline, and I personally believe she will guide La Salle in the right direction regarding self-discipline and behavior.</li>
<li>However, I do not think it is effective to express the increased personal workload resulting from complaints from the public caused by students' reckless actions as guilt placed on all students, as this may lead to downsides, such as:
<ul>
<li>Making students feel they are "bearing the guilt of others' wrongdoing," thus complaining about "wrongful treatment" or "injustice."</li>
<li>Furthermore, students may perceive "everything" as "not their fault," which leads them to focus on excuses rather than self-reflection, rendering the whole "behavior issues" discussion "effectively useless."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While one hour of staying behind may be sufficient to convey the message to La Salle junior form students, it could also disrupt students' and teachers' plans if they have events to attend.</li>
<li>Moreover, this could slightly impact the already concerning teacher-student relationship in junior forms, as this act might be perceived as "disturbing" and could be seen as an "evil tease" from the "teacher overlords," leading to feelings of anger that are difficult to dissipate and may become a rebel.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>My Analysis of the Motive of Miss Cheung</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, the original purpose of the discipline talk is to learn right from wrong through others' mistakes or misdeeds.</li>
<li>It successfully conveys and reports on the issues at La Salle College.</li>
<li>However, this also plants a fear in students' minds that teachers could and will take disciplinary actions.</li>
<li>Finally, the 10 minutes of "calm down time" could provide some individuals with the opportunity to reflect on improvements in discipline.</li>
<li>Although Miss Cheung may have to be perceived as the "bad teacher" in some eyes, she still made the brave and resilient choice to act.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>My Prediction of La Salle Students' Behavior</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>This event has instilled a fear and anger regarding potential disciplinary actions from teachers, which will not dissipate quickly.</li>
<li>However, as time passes, most students will likely focus on "how bad the teachers were" instead of self-reflection, as anger is much easier to remember than one's own wrongdoing.</li>
<li>Therefore, I hope that teachers will not use this event to instill fear in students, as this will only further cultivate anger towards the teachers.</li>
<li>I also hope that teachers will take action with patience and serve with genuine care, regardless of whether it pertains to behavior or teaching, because, as is widely believed, teachers should be passionate about teaching rather than treating it as just a job.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details open=""><summary>
<h2>Conclusion</h2></summary>
<ul>
<li>Miss Cheung's speech was "inspirational, based on a belief in change, and demonstrated her perseverance to take action."</li>
<li>Miss Cheung is one of the few teachers who still holds hope and love for improving La Salle students' behavior and is willing to take actionable steps rather than blindly executing formal and ineffective orders.</li>
<li>I believe that guilting students over personal workload is not an effective means of addressing behavioral issues.</li>
<li>However, while instilling fear in students may work in the short term, it cannot sustain long-term effectiveness and may lead to significant problems.</li>
